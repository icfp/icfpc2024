# 14. a nice normal difference-of-difference-able route
# BUT you start with non-zero offset and velocity
# so first you need to build a "runway", get up to speed
# to be at the right place with the right velocity
# and from then onwards it's difference of differences

# too big to traverse row-by-row
# pretty much entirely TSP

# 19. a small scatter, dense
# we don't solve this, it's obvious that a solution exists
# (scan row by row at worst -> 10k moves)
# but my algorithms don't work well here
